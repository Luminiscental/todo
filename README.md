# todo

Simple todo list cli tool; can add, remove and list items plus pomodoro-style give yourself a set number of minutes to work on one.
Config file can be made at `.todo/config` to change where it is stored (e.g. `todoFile = path/to/todolist`) and what the default number of minutes to complete
a task is (e.g. `timeout = 5`)

If for whatever reason you want to use this run the copyJar task and move `todo` into your path somewhere (no windows support sorry)
